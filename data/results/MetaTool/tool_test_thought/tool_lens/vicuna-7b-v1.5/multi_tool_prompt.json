Typically, there are four reasons why you might need to use external tools:\n[Reasons Begin]\nA. Solving issues with real-time or external data, databases or APIs\nB. Handling specialized inputs/outputs\nC. Enhancing domain tasks beyond LLM's capabilities\nD. User customization, personalization and interaction\n[Reasons End]\nHere is the user's query:\n[User Query Begins]\nI need to schedule a drone delivery to the address with the code 13101001, and my IP address is 192.168.1.1.\n[User Query Ends]\nBased on the above query, if you think it's necessary to use external tools, please respond with \"yes\"; otherwise, respond with \"no.\" Additionally, you should provide a brief explanation for your answer.", "tool": ["tool_lens.education.miraisoft__training.dashboard", "tool_lens.weather.weather_a_p_i_com.i_p__lookup__a_p_i", "tool_lens.location.n_a_v_i_t_i_m_e__geocoding.address_code"], "query": "I need to schedule a drone delivery to the address with the code 13101001, and my IP address is 192.168.1.1.", "res": "Yes.\n\nThe reason for this is that the query involves real-time or external data, databases, or APIs, specifically the IP address of the user. As an intelligent agent, I do not have access to real-time data or external APIs, and my knowledge is limited to the information that I have been trained on. Therefore, in order to accurately schedule a drone delivery to the specified address, I would need to use external tools that have access to real-time data and can communicate with the relevant APIs."}]
